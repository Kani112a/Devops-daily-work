Explaination of the code in day2_variables_conditions.sh file
Tells the system: “Use Bash shell to run this script”
Without this, Linux may not know which shell to use
DISK=$(df / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d'%' -f1)
df/   shows disk usage of the root filesystem
tail -1   ---> takes only the last line
awk '{print $5}'  --->prints 5th column
cut -d'%' -f1    --->Remove the symbol 
stores the value in the variable DISK
It will loop 3 times for i
-gt refers greater than 
fi   ---> end of if condition
done   --->end of loop
